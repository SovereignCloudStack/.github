# Sovereign Cloud Stack

[Sovereign Cloud Stack (SCS)](https://scs.community/) is a network of existing and future providers of standardized sovereign cloud and container infrastructure to join forces in defining, implementing and operating a fully open, federated, compatible platform. By joining forces, the platform can support a healthy ecosystem for service and application developers and strengthen the digitalization efforts in Europe without creating large risks to lose control over the technology and the data.
Good starting points are the [docs](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/Docs) repository and the '[How to contribute page](https://scs.community/contribute/)' page on the main website.
