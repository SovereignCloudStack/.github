# Sovereign Cloud Stack

[Sovereign Cloud Stack (SCS)](https://scs.community/) is a network of existing and future providers of standardized sovereign cloud and container infrastructure to join forces in defining, implementing and operating a fully open, federated, compatible platform. By joining forces, the platform can support a healthy ecosystem for service and application developers and strengthen the digitalization efforts in Europe without creating large risks to lose control over the technology and the data.
Good starting points are the [docs](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/Docs) repository and the '[How to contribute page](https://scs.community/contribute/)' page on the main website. The Docs repository (Design-Docs directory) also hosts the SCS standards.

## Contributing

Please see our [How to contribute](https://scs.community/contribute/) page.

We appreciate contribution to strategy and implementation. Please join our community â€” or just leave input on the github [issues](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/issues/issues) and PRs. We have a [public taskboard](https://github.com/orgs/SovereignCloudStack/projects/6). Have a look at our [contributor guide](https://docs.scs.community/contributor-docs). We also have defined a [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to document the expected behavior of contributors and how we deal with cases where individuals fail to meet the expectation.
With its direct leverage on the overall quality test automation and a high level of transparency about the status are very important to us. The status of our Continuous Integration can be viewed on the [SCS Zuul](https://zuul.scs.community/t/SCS/builds) and [OSISM Zuul](https://zuul.services.betacloud.xyz/t/osism/builds) status pages. We are happy if you draw our attention to special topics with tickets here.

Please also look at the upstream projects from the CNCF and OIF and at the [OSISM project](https://github.com/OSISM/) which covers the SCS reference implementation for the Infra/IaaS layer.
